Im learning some basics commands in bash and i want to make a script that runs several commands in a row im going to use this script in patching some patches to (dwm,dmenu and st) beacuse i don't want to always run the same long commands every time i patch

im going to name this script easier-script and it can be called by typing 'es'

im sorry for my poor english

im a high-school student (12th grade) im very busy studying for school so i well be working on this project in my free time
